## Introduction
Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is a communicable respiratory disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus. It was first reported to the World Health Organization (WHO) on December 31, 2019, and by January 30, 2020, the COVID-19 outbreak had been declared a global health emergency.
The rapid outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic presented an alarming health crisis. Apart from the health impact, there were some social and economic impacts felt globally. This project aims to build a report to gain insights into how the COVID-19 pandemic impacted the world economy.

In this analysis, three factors will be considered;
- the GDP growth rate
- GDP per capita
- Inflation

## Some of the skillset used in the project
Data Gathering: The dataset includes data for COVID-19 sourced from World Health Organization (WHO) website, and data for Inflation, GDP growth rate, and GDP per capita sourced from the World Bank website.

 Data wrangling: The process was done in PostgreSQL. it is documented in the article published on Medium.

Exploratory data analysis: This was done in PostgreSQL. The exploratory data analysis involved exploring the data and answering some questions about how each factor i.e inflation rate, growth rate, and individual productivity were affected due by the spread of COVID-19.

Data visualization: I used powerbi to represent the data by creating visuals. 

Documentation: I wrote an article to share my process and insights-[link to article](https://medium.com/@jacintaezeabikwa6/analysis-of-the-impact-of-the-covid-19-pandemic-on-the-global-economy-8f7c30f68613)

## Exploratory Data Analysis

For the purpose of exploring the data to find patterns and draw insights,the following questions were asked

* which countries was most affected by COVID-19?

* How did COVID affect inflation?

* What was the economic growth rate of countries before and during COVID-19?

* How did the spread of COVID-19 affect the living standards of COVID-affected countries?

## Insight

- There is a positive relationship between COVID cases and the inflation rate, as COVID cases increased, the inflation rate increased.
On average, inflation was high in 2017 and then decreased in 2018. it later increased through 2019 till 2021. The spread of Covid-19 increased the rate of inflation in most country and this caused a lot of countries economy to experienced overheating.

- The fast growing economy to invest in as of 2021 are Libya, Maldives, Guyana, Macao SAR China, Panama, Moldova, Bahamas, Ireland, Peru, Honduras

- A high economic growth is not equal to a high standard of living, this means that a country can be performing well, and the economy is growing but the overall wealth of individual is not growing due to other factors such as high inflation, rate of unemployment, and fast-growing population

- The best countries to live in considering individual standards of living are Luxembourg, Singapore, Ireland, Qatar, Bermuda, Norway, Switzerland, Macao SAR China, United States of America, and North America.

- Countries with low GDP per capita have a low standard of living and low performance as the citizens of such countries are struggling economically and the country cannot meet the needs of its citizens.

- The safest countries to live in are Democratic people’s republic of Korea (North Korea), Turkmenistan, Tokelau, and Saint Helena. These countries are labeled the safest because they don’t have a single COVID-19 case recorded.

## Conclusion

The COVID-19 pandemic has caused an unprecedented global economic impact at an astonishing rate, leading to rapid economic downturns in many countries. The COVID-19 pandemic has had far-reaching economic consequences, including the second largest decline in global economic growth (COVID-19 recession) , a significant impact on inflation, and also affected the living standards of the citizens.

The prices of goods and services increased due to government policies put in place to reduce the spread of COVID-19; this led to scarcity, less production, and a decline in economic growth for all countries.

Most countries GDP decreased in 2020 and then increased in 2021, this is because the spread of COVID-19 affected economic activities negatively.
